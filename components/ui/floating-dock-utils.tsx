// Actually, I need to make sure @tabler/icons-react is installed or use Lucide replacements.
// The user code uses Lucide mainly. I will replace IconLayoutNavbarCollapse with a Lucide equivalent to avoid extra deps if possible,
// OR I will install @tabler/icons-react.
// To be safe and minimal, I will swap IconLayoutNavbarCollapse for a Lucide icon in the previous file.
